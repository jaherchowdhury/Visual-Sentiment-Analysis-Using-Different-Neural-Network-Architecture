# Visual-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Different-Neural-Network-Architecture
#Introduction
This repository provides the source code and raw datasets of the project "Visual Sentiment Analysis Using Different Neural Network Architecture".Now-a-days, sentiment analysis and transfer learning has become a famous topic in computer vision. We are proposing a comparative analysis of the neural network models with the help of transfer learning and how this transfer learning is impacting the field of visual sentiment analysis.We are also proposing how the histogram analysis and different hyperparameters are impacting the models performance.



# Architecture
The Evaluation will be done on three different stages:

Stage 01: Model Evaluation of Tranfer Learned/Base Models:

Stage 02: Comparative Analysis of Base Model vs Transfer Learned Models:

# Data

The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) is a set of totally 4900 pictures of human facial expressions.The Averaged KDEF (AKDEF) is a set of averaged pictures created from the original KDEF images.

The KDEF and AKDEF materials were produced in 1998 and have since then been freely shared within the research community. By today, KDEF has been used in more than 1500 research publications.

This Dataset contains seven emotion classes named as: anger,fear, happy, neutral, disgust, sad, surprise. each emotion classes have 420 images of man and women. This dataset is the subset of the orginal KDEF dataset.
